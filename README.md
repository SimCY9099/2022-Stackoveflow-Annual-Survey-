# Data Cleaning and Analysis for Stack Overflow 2022 Developer Survey by Python

## Introduction:
- This project have focused on cleaning and preparing the Stack Overflow 2022 Developer Survey for analysis. The goal of this proejct is to ensure data quality and integirty by addressing issues such as missing value, duplicate records and inconsistent formatting.
- To make it easier to analyse, I have set a couple of guiding questions for myself:
  
  1. Which type of company offer the highest annual compensation in USD?
  2. How did developer think anput remote work?
  3. Did experience effect the level of pay (in USD)?
  4. What is the most popular way to learn code?
  5. Is getting a Master's degree easier to get a developer role?
 
## Project Overview
- The data cleaning process involved several steps, including data exploration, handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing data formats, and addressing outliers. Through this process, we aimed to create a clean and reliable dataset for further analysis.
 
## Data Description:
- Source: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey
- The dataset is formatted in CSV format.
- Variables: The dataset includes various columns such as Respondent, Country, Age, Employment, Salary, and more. Each column represents a specific attribute or characteristic of the survey respondents.
- Size: The dataset comprises approximately 50,000 rows and 30 columns.
- Missing Values: The dataset contains missing values in some columns, which required careful handling during the cleaning process.

## Data Cleaning Proecss:
- Explored the dataset to understand the structure and identify the potential issue
- Selected necessary columns for analysis to ensure data integrity and focus on relevant variables.
- Handled missing values by applying appropriate strategies deletion based on the specific context and impact on the analysis.
- Addressed inconsistent or incorrect data formats by standardizing them to ensure uniformity across the dataset.
- Removed irrelevant or redundant columns that do not contribute to the analysis.
- Checked for and resolved duplicate records to maintain data accuracy.
